## Ongoing Research
I'm currently interested in various numerical invaraints of permutation groups. In particualr maximal irredundant base size and relational complexity. 



## PhD Research

## Masters Dissertation
For my dissertation, I looked at Buildings, Chamber Graphs and Mathieu groups. Although the sporadic groups do not <img align="right" src="https://veronicakelsey.github.io/images/m12ink.png" width="110">  give rise to buildings, Ronan and Stroth constructed geometries for each of the sporadic groups that mimic the construction of buildings. I calculated the chamber graphs of these geometries for M_12, M_22, M_23 and M_24 in Magma, and investigated what "Building-like" behaviours their chamber graphs exhibited. I was also able to use more combinatorial approaches to calculate the chamber graphs of M_12 and M_22 by hand. The work on M_12 and M_22 had not appeared in the literature prior to this. 



## Undergraduate Research

In the summer of my third year of undergraduate, I received a bursary from the London Mathematical Society to spend the summer researching. During this project, Peter Rowley and I wrote two papers. In one we calculated the chamber graphs of some GABs (Geometries that are Almost Buildings) and in the second we characterised the M_24-obits of octad triples
