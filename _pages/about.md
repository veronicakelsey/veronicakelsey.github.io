I am a research fellow at the University of Manchester [Department of mathematics](https://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk).

I completed my PhD at the University of St Andrews, where I was part of the [algebra & combinatorics research group](https://algebra-combinatorics.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk).

My current research is on numerical invariants and generation of simple and almost simple groups.
